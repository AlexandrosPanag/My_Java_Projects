Quick-Find Algorithm
----

This quick find algorithm is called eager algorithm to solve so called dynamic connectivity problem.  The structure of the data includes an integer array id[] of size N. N is any integer. Integer array id[] is supposed to be a range from 0 to N-1. p and q are 2 integers in the id array. p and q are connected if they have the same id.

This is an a Java implementation of how the algorithm works.
