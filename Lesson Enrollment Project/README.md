Lesson Enrollment Project
-------

This work is based on the assignment from the University of Ioannina Department of Informatics & Telecommunications during the academic year 2020-2021, this is my solution to the task.

In this assignment we were tasked using the Swing Library among many others, to create a database that simulates how a student can enroll to a lesson, have a lesson he can register to, finding the average lesson grade for all the students and then export everything into a .txt data if the user chooses. All while using Object Oriented Programming and official Java libraries.
