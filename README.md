What is Java?
----
What is Java technology and why do I need it?
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the codes will require the algs4 library to function which can be found here: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/.


Other projects are pure IMPLEMENTATIONS, which means, that in order for them to fully work you need to do a couple of minor changes. The purpose of these implementations is to explain the overall logic behind the problem and suggest a way to solve it.
